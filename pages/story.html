      <p>
        Catherine Edgerton has been inking, layering and stitching multi-media
        records in hand-bound books since she was fourteen. Her motivation has
        been to challenge borders, externally as well as within her own psyche.
        Self / community taught, Edgerton uses a narrative intersectional
        approach to her work. Her main areas of focus are race, surrealism,
        addiction, and mental dis-ease in a dystopian society.

        In 2013, Edgerton began working with stained-glass, creating multi-media
        kaleidoscopes and television lanterns. In addition to glass, she uses
        transparent found treasures such as bottles, film slides, and bug wings
        to create fragmented imagery of worlds and landscapes.
      </p>

      <p>
        Edgerton has made most of her work in and with community. Most recently
        she initiated the Durham Art Asylum, which builds creative pathways and
        reduces isolation among folks who struggle with mental health and
        addiction in Durham, NC.
